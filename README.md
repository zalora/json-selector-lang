# JSON Selector Language

## A tiny language for selecting JSON values

JSON Selector Language, or JSL, can be used to dynamically select JSON values.
It is meant for use in client-side environments like the browser where
bandwidth and performance constraints exist.

It was inspired by projects like jq and JMESPath, but is **tiny** by designâ€”
it only has two expressions.

### Usage

As an example, if your data looks like the following:

```javascript
const json = {
  data: {
    Data: {
      items: [1, 3, 5, 7],
    },
  },
};
```

You can select the `items` array as follows:

```javascript
import { jsl } from 'json-selector-lang';

try {
  const itemsSelector = jsl.compile('.data.Data.items');
  const items = jsl.evaluate(data, itemsSelector);

  // [1, 3, 5, 7] should be the value of items
} catch (e) {
  // catch the errors generated by the JSL here
}
```

#### Tips

- Compile your selectors once and reuse as much as possible.
